/**
 * Audit-log types (Phase 6 foundation per ADR-0027 + SECURITY.md §4).
 *
 * Append-only structured event log for security-relevant actions:
 *   - MSP-Bridge API calls (read in Phase 6, write in Phase 7)
 *   - Workspace switches (Phase 2a — currently uses pino directly; can
 *     migrate to this audit-log in a follow-up)
 *   - Secret reads / writes (Phase 3d secrets domain)
 *   - Skill lifecycle transitions (Phase 5 sandbox/promote events)
 *
 * The full SECURITY.md §4 audit-store spec covers retention, rotation,
 * forwarding, and signature requirements. This module provides the
 * **wire format** + **append API** that all those concerns build on.
 *
 * Bridge implementations live in `claude-os-msp` (per ADR-0030) and
 * import this types/logger surface from the public-core (Claude-portable).
 *
 * @module @core/audit/types
